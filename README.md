## Usage

This repository serves as a centralized location for storing reusable Python and Bash scripts. Scripts are organized by language in their respective directories.

### Python Scripts

Python scripts are located in the `python_scripts/` directory. See the README in that directory for more information.

### Bash Scripts

Bash scripts are located in the `bash_scripts/` directory. See the README in that directory for more information.

## Contributing Scripts

When adding a new script:
1. Place it in the appropriate directory (`python_scripts/` or `bash_scripts/`)
2. Use descriptive filenames
3. Include documentation (docstrings for Python, comments for Bash)
4. For Bash scripts, make them executable: `chmod +x script_name.sh`
